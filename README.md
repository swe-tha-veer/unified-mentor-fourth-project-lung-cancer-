# unified-mentor-fourth-project-lung-cancer

## Description

The Lung Cancer Prediction project is a machine learning application designed to predict the likelihood of lung cancer in individuals based on health-related and lifestyle features. Using real-world patient data, the project analyzes factors such as age, smoking habits, family history, and symptoms to classify whether a person is at risk of lung cancer. This enables early detection and supports preventive healthcare decisions.

## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to analyze patient data and predict lung cancer risk. The goal is to assist medical professionals and individuals in identifying high-risk cases early. Python is used for data preprocessing, analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Concepts Included

The coding in this project covers several key concepts in data analysis and machine learning:

1. **Data Handling with Pandas**

   * Patient data is loaded, cleaned, and managed using Pandas.
   * Features such as age, smoking habits, chronic diseases, and symptoms are prepared for analysis.

2. **Data Visualization**

   * **Bar Graphs:** Compare categorical variables like gender distribution or smoking status.
   * **Histograms:** Show the distribution of numerical features such as age or number of cigarettes smoked.
   * **Pie Charts:** Visualize proportions, like the percentage of patients with and without lung cancer.

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Transform raw data into meaningful features for better prediction.
   * Includes encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.

4. **Machine Learning Models**

   * Classification models (like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests) are used to predict lung cancer risk.
   * The model is trained on historical patient data and tested for accuracy.

5. **Model Evaluation**

   * Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices are used to evaluate model performance.
   * Provides insight into the reliability and effectiveness of predictions.

## How to Use

1. Load the patient dataset using Python and Pandas.
2. Preprocess and clean the data.
3. Train a classification model on the dataset.
4. Visualize insights using bar graphs, histograms, and pie charts.
5. Evaluate the model to predict lung cancer risk.

## Tools & Libraries

* **Python** – Main programming language.
* **Pandas & NumPy** – For data handling and analysis.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – For creating visualizations (bar graphs, histograms, pie charts).
* **Scikit-learn** – For building and evaluating machine learning models.
